            <h1><strong>WHAT IS THE COST OF LIVING CRISIS ?</strong></h1>
            <p>
                The ‘cost of living crisis’ refers to the fall in ‘real’ disposable incomes (that is, adjusted for
                inflation
                and after taxes and benefits) that the UK has experienced since late 2021. It is being caused
                predominantly by
                high inflation outstripping wage and benefit increases and has been further exacerbated by recent tax
                increases.

            <h1>BUDGETING</h1>
            <h2> WHY IS IT IMPORTANT </h2>

            <p>
                The word budget to most of us means spend less but in its truest sense it means taking time to ensure
                you don't spend more than you have coming in and by budgeting you will have a financial plan in place
                to ensure this doesn't happen. Some signs you need to start budgeting could be:<br>
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>You can’t pay your bills</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Your credit cards are always maxed out</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Important bills are those you avoid</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Money is a consistent worry</strong></li>

            </ol>
            <p>
            Setting up a budget plan is reasonably straightforward but does involve being completely honest about your
            income and outgoings and then keeping it up to date as things change.
            Once you have compared your income and outgoings, if you are spending more than you have coming in you
            will
            need to decide what you can do without. On the other hand if you find you have more coming in than going out
            now
            is a good time to start saving for any unexpected costs.
            Budgeting is important because it helps you focus on what you spend your money on making it easier to
            prioritise
            your needs and which other things are most important to you.

            <h1> INSURANCE</h1>
            <h2> WHY IS IT IMPORTANT</h2>
            <p>
                Insurance is a way of managing unexpected and unavoidable risks.  It is something most of us have but
                hope we will never use.  When you buy insurance you are not purchasing something you can see but a
                promise that if something cataclysmic happens in your life it will provide you with financial assistance
                meaning you incur minimum loss.
                </p>
            <p>
                During a cost of living crisis or a period of reduced income it can be very tempting to see insurance
                products as an unnecessary expense but before cancelling the premiums it is worth checking what they
                cover and the benefits of keeping it in place.
                </p>
            <p>
                The most popular types of insurance policies cover life,critical illness, home and automotive such as
                cars and motorbikes.
                </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Life and Critical illness:</strong>  This covers both you and your family if you are either unable to work due
                to one of the illnesses covered by the policy or ensures your family can continue with their current
                lifestyle if the worst should happen.
</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Home insurance:</strong>  Your home is not just a building its a place you have made feel secure and comfortable
                usually over a period of time and at great cost. The average contents of a UK home will have cost in
                excess of 35k.  A relatively small cost in comparison will ensure that if something happens that is
                covered by the policy such as fire or flood then you will be able to repair your home and replace any damaged items.
</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Automotive:</strong>  As motor vehicles can cause serious damage to other people this type of policy is by law
                compulsory. It is still important though to ensure it covers what you need to at the best price.

                If after looking at the benefits of the policies you have in place you decide that they are necessary
                for your piece of mind then it is still worth shopping around to ensure you have the best price for the cover you need.
