            <h2>2.3m households missed an essential payment in January, data reveals</h2>
            <p>
                About 2.3 million households missed an essential payment in January - an increase of 400,000 on the month before, but similar to previous years.

                Essential payments - which include mortgages, rent, loans and credit cards - often peak in January, according to Which?'s consumer insight tracker.

                The monthly poll of approximately 2,000 people discovered that almost 59% made at least one financial adjustment, such as selling items, dipping into savings or cutting back on essentials, to cover their spending. However, that's lower than the peak of 65% in September.

            <p>
                The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will soon be rolling out the first instalment of the £900 Cost of Living payments.

                Millions of people on means-tested benefits are expected to receive the first payment worth £301. It will be the latest in support for households which was previously announced in the autumn statement after eight million people received £650 in Cost of Living payments throughout 2022.

                Households receiving means-tested benefits such as Universal Credit, Pension Credit, and tax credits will receive extra support from Spring. Meanwhile, a separate £150 will be made available for over six million people living with disabilities as well as £300 for over eight million pensioners on top of their Winter Fuel Payments.

            <h1><strong>WHAT IS THE COST OF LIVING CRISIS ?</strong></h1>
            <p>
                The ‘cost of living crisis’ refers to the fall in ‘real’ disposable incomes (that is, adjusted for
                inflation
                and after taxes and benefits) that the UK has experienced since late 2021. It is being caused
                predominantly by
                high inflation outstripping wage and benefit increases and has been further exacerbated by recent tax
                increases.

            <h1>BUDGETING</h1>
            <h2> WHY IS IT IMPORTANT </h2>

            <p>
                The word budget to most of us means spend less but in its truest sense it means taking time to ensure
                you don't spend more than you have coming in and by budgeting you will have a financial plan in place
                to ensure this doesn't happen. Some signs you need to start budgeting could be:<br>
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>You can’t pay your bills</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Your credit cards are always maxed out</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Important bills are those you avoid</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Money is a consistent worry</strong></li>

            </ol>
            <p>
            Setting up a budget plan is reasonably straightforward but does involve being completely honest about your
            income and outgoings and then keeping it up to date as things change.
            Once you have compared your income and outgoings, if you are spending more than you have coming in you
            will
            need to decide what you can do without. On the other hand if you find you have more coming in than going out
            now
            is a good time to start saving for any unexpected costs.
            Budgeting is important because it helps you focus on what you spend your money on making it easier to
            prioritise
            your needs and which other things are most important to you.

            <h1> INSURANCE</h1>
            <h2> WHY IS IT IMPORTANT</h2>
            <p>
                Insurance is a way of managing unexpected and unavoidable risks.  It is something most of us have but
                hope we will never use.  When you buy insurance you are not purchasing something you can see but a
                promise that if something cataclysmic happens in your life it will provide you with financial assistance
                meaning you incur minimum loss.
                </p>
            <p>
                During a cost of living crisis or a period of reduced income it can be very tempting to see insurance
                products as an unnecessary expense but before cancelling the premiums it is worth checking what they
                cover and the benefits of keeping it in place.
                </p>
            <p>
                The most popular types of insurance policies cover life,critical illness, home and automotive such as
                cars and motorbikes.
                </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Life and Critical illness:</strong>  This covers both you and your family if you are either unable to work due
                to one of the illnesses covered by the policy or ensures your family can continue with their current
                lifestyle if the worst should happen.
</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Home insurance:</strong>  Your home is not just a building its a place you have made feel secure and comfortable
                usually over a period of time and at great cost. The average contents of a UK home will have cost in
                excess of 35k.  A relatively small cost in comparison will ensure that if something happens that is
                covered by the policy such as fire or flood then you will be able to repair your home and replace any damaged items.
</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Automotive:</strong>  As motor vehicles can cause serious damage to other people this type of policy is by law
                compulsory. It is still important though to ensure it covers what you need to at the best price.

                If after looking at the benefits of the policies you have in place you decide that they are necessary
                for your piece of mind then it is still worth shopping around to ensure you have the best price for the cover you need.

            <h2>Grocery inflation hits new record level, adding '£788 to annual bill'</h2>
            <p>
                Grocery inflation has hit a new record level since Christmas, according to closely watched industry data which has abruptly ended hopes that price falls would gain momentum.

                The Kantar Worldpanel agency reported an annual rate of 16.7% during the four weeks to 22 January.

                It marked a steep increase on the 14.4% seen in December, when discounting by chains in the run-up to the festive season helped temper the pace of price increases.

                The report said that the record new rate meant that families faced a potential £788 annual rise in the cost of their regular shopping basket as a result of the hike.

            <h2>Downsizing on the rise amid cost of living crisis</h2>
            <p>
                Record energy bills and the cost-of-living crisis has prompted a surge in downsizing activity over the past 12 months, new research claims.

                Analysis of user activity on reallymoving.com has found the proportion of downsizers rose by 41% between January and December 2022.

                Value downsizers, defined as those who are moving to a cheaper property than the one they’re selling, currently account for 43% of all home moves – up from 24% a year ago and now at the highest level since 2015., reallymoving said.

                With February half-term approaching, HMRC is encouraging families to find out more about the scheme and to see if they are eligible for support.
